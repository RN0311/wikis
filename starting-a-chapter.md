# How to Start a [Women Who Go](https://womenwhogo.org) Chapter


*NOTE: You must identfy as a woman or gender minority to start a chapter*

### Suggested TODOs:
1. You must identify as a woman or another gender minority to start a chapter.
1. Create a Twitter account for your chapter

  This is helpful for getting the word out about your events, seeking sponsors, etc.
1. We can make you an @womenwhogo.org email account if you like (eg. nyc@womenwhogo.org). Please let us know if you need one.
1. We provide free meetup accounts for your group. Create a meetup account for yourself, if you don't already have one. Then email hello@womenwhogo.org and we will create a meetup for your city and make you the co-owner.
1. Submit a PR to add your chapter's links to womenwhogo.org; the file you need to change is [here](https://github.com/womenwhogo/womenwhogo.org/blob/master/womenwhogo.org/index.html). Our very own [Maartje Eyskens](https://twitter.com/MaartjeME) has set up auto-magical deploys with Travis CI, so your new change should be live on womenwhogo.org minutes after you submit the PR.
1. Join our Slack, and take advantage of the #organizers channel to get advice from other WWG organizers. If you don't have a slack account, request one here: https://www.womenwhogo.org/invite.html.
1. Decide what you would like to do for your first meetup - for Women Who Go SF, I did a few exercises to help people share about their experiences being one of few women in Go, and we decided together on the purpose of the group. The Women Who Go NYC chapter did a tutorial/hackathon to help women learn more about Go. Their tutorials are open source here: github.com/womenwhogonyc. If you need more resources, ideas or help, please feel free to reach out to hello@womenwhogo.org.

  We also have an email distribution list for WWG chapter organizers. This is a great place to seek help or tips from other chapter organizers.
1. Find a sponsor for your event! The best place I've found for sourcing sponsors has been Twitter. If you post a link to your meetup event with a request for sponsors, perhaps even tagging the local Go group, I've found that people get excited about the initiative and seem to be eager to help. Tag [@womenwhogo](https://twitter.com/womenwhogo) for a retweet too!
1. Continue hosting events! Again, myself and the other chapter organizers are very happy to help with event ideas and sponsors. You are not alone!
